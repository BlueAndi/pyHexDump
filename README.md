# pyHexDump
A CLI tool written in Python to dump binary files and files in intel hex format. It can generate a report for any file based on report template. This is useful for images which contain specific data always on the same address, e.g. a CRC, signature, etc.

There are a lot of hex viewers already, but I was not able to find one which I could configure in a way to generate something like a report.
